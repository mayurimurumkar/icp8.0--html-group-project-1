<p>The first IPL tournament, held over 44 days in 2008, was won by the Rajasthan Royals,<br> one of the smaller-market franchises, captained by Shane Warne,<br> the great Australian bowler. The IPL has come a long way since its first season.<br> According to a Forbes report in 2022, the average value of the IPL franchises shows an annualized growth rate of 24 percent,<br> up from $67 million in 2009 (of 8 teams) to $1.04 billion in 2022 (of 10 teams). <br>This growth in average team value, when compared with the past 13 years’<br> growth rate of 10 percent for National Football League (NFL) team values and 16 percent for National Basketball Association team values, is remarkable. <br>Expectations about the 2023–27 media contract contributed to the team value in 2022. <br>For the five-year cycle starting in 2023, <br>streaming and TV rights were sold for a record total of $6 billion to Viacom18 and Star India (owned by Disney). <br>This is more than double the amount at which media rights were sold for the previous cycle.<br> Such has been the IPL’s success that the BCCI announced a new league for women’s cricket, <br>the Women’s Premier League (WPL), which played its inaugural season in March 2023.<br> In the wake of the IPL’s success,<br> other cricketing countries scrambled to grab some of the riches by forming their own domestic T20 leagues. <br>Major League Cricket (MLC), a U.S. T20 cricket league launched in 2023,<br> also has its IPL connections: <br>four of its six franchises have investments from IPL franchise owners, <br>and many IPL cricketers feature in MLC.</p>
