    <P><h3>t's a new era for Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) as they head into the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 season with
         Virat Kohli not at the helm of affairs. the  India star brought down the curtains on a 10-year-long captaincy stint at the RCB 
         after the end of the last season'.

        The biggest talking point in the lead up to IPL 2022 was RCB captain and the franchise finally unveiled Faf du Plessis as
         Virat Kohli's successor. The former South Africa captain brings with him plenty of leadership experience and success in the IPL 
         after having spent nearly a decade at Chennai Super kings.
        NEW CAPTAIN, NEW ERA
        Faf du Plessis is a well-respected figure in international cricket, and he will be hoping to reverse the fortunes of RCB,
         who have consistently underperformed in the IPL over the years. The former South African captain has already stressed that
          it will be a collaborative approach and that the energy of Virat Kohli will be crucial to their progress.
